Overview
The Supermarket Inventory Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and optimize inventory tracking for supermarkets. This project is part of the Creative Collaboration Project, which merges individual passions into a collaborative solution. Inspired by the fast-paced environment of retail and the importance of inventory control, this system allows administrators to manage stock efficiently, ensuring products are well-organized, up-to-date, and easily accessible.

Our creative collaboration expands on this idea by integrating an optional Recipe Suggestion Feature that recommends meal ideas based on the available supermarket stock. This brings together the worlds of retail management and culinary creativityâ€”offering users a seamless and engaging experience.
